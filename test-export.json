    "description": "<p>This study is the first approach to treat human-bear interactions as a social-ecological system across time and space. Analyses combine both, social and ecological methodologies. The goal is to obtain detailed and structured results describing the linkages between social perceptions, land-use change and urbanization. Those linkages will help to identify key factors that can achieve resilient bear conservation while managing for an increasing human footprint in Northern regions.</p>\r\n<p>On the spatial scale this research approach compares Sakhalin Island, Russian Far East, with Alaska, focusing on the human-urban interface around Yuzhno, the largest city on Sakhalin Island, and the Anchorage-Kenai Peninsula region in Southern Alaska. Comparison across the Pacific Rim holds its strength in similarities (like economic interests in oil and gas development, fisheries) and key differences (implementation of a bear management) between regions. Methods include a mixed methods approach to gain qualitative and quantitative information from local people, remote sensing to generate maps in relation to urbanisation and land-use, and predictive modelling analysing relationships between parameters. The time-extend combines data from the 1990ies till today in three 10 year intervals. All research is carried out in both study regions in the same fashion, and compared will help understand key factors increasing human-bear encounters in each region. Results will show positive as well as negative (conflict) encounters between humans and bears, and model hot spots; for both encounter types in relation to urbanization and habitat. Additionally residentsperceptions will be compared, and future human-bear encounters predicted.</p>",

    "description": "<strong>Project Abstract</strong><br>\r\n<p>This project offers the first scientific research of fish communities in the Fox River Flats Critical Habitat Area, located in Kachemak Bay, southern Cook Inlet, Alaska. Fish assemblages were assessed in a variety of habitats initially, with research becoming focused on juvenile salmon in four tidal channel habitats spanning an estuarine gradient from oligohaline near the top of the estuary to euryhaline near the mouth. Water temperature, salinity and depth in these channels were driven by varying mixing of glacial melt water from the Fox River and tidal influence. Over 14,000 fish were sampled in the four tidal channels over the duration of the project. Juvenile Coho and Sockeye salmon were the most abundant species in the channels, with both species peaking in July, with densities of 30 Coho/m and 18 sockeye/m. Both species were present from at least late April through early October. Diet samples were analyzed from 113 Coho and 104 Sockeye. Juvenile Coho and Sockeye salmon fed on 83 different prey taxa overall, with Sockeye having somewhat more compressed diets than Coho salmon. Seasonal bioenergetic models show high rates of growth in August (0.15-0.19 g g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), likely fueled by high consumption rates and high energy density of prey. The prolonged presence and active feeding, substantiates that the Fox River estuary provides is providing beneficial rearing and outmigration staging habitats for juvenile Coho and Sockeye salmon. </p>",

The focus for this work are the springs and upwellings that provide salmon with the cold-water stepping stones needed to make their way up and down otherwise warming streams, and also the warmer, ice-free nooks for overwintering juvenile salmon. The identification of these refugia as a key component to strategic conservation planning provides the best hope to embrace realistic climate adaptation strategies for salmon protection.</p>\r\n<p>Watershed Sciences flew the South Fork Anchor River on June 30th, 2010 and the North Fork Anchor River and Ninilchik River on July 10, 2012. They flew at an altitude of 2,000 feet and the TIR sensors collected images every second which resulted in a 2-foot image resolution. And even in the cool summer of 2010, the location and thermal influence of 18 tributaries, 23 seeps and springs, 11 sloughs, and 9 small side channels and drains is apparent in the South Fork Anchor River imagery.</p>",
